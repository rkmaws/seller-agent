"""Fulfillment-adjacent helpers for deal-time audience-plan handling.

Per proposal §5.1 Step 2 (snapshot honor policy):

> If the seller drops support for an audience type after booking but before
> fulfillment (e.g., agentic capability is decommissioned), the seller honors
> the snapshot frozen at booking time. The buyer's `audience_plan_id` hash is
> the proof of what was agreed.

`honor_audience_plan_snapshot()` is the minimal helper fulfillment paths can
call to retrieve the frozen plan and emit a structured warning when the
seller's *current* capabilities are weaker than what was promised at booking.

Bead: ar-sn8f (proposal §5.1 Step 2 + §6 row 11).

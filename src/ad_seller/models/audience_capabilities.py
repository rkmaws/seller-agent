"""Typed `AudienceCapabilities` for seller `Package` positioning.

Replaces the flat `audience_segment_ids: list[str]` on `Package` with a
typed three-dimension structure parallel to how `cat`/`cattax` already
handles content taxonomy versioning:

- standard segments (IAB Audience Taxonomy 1.1 IDs, the existing dimension)
- contextual segments (IAB Content Taxonomy 3.1 IDs as audience-intent,
  distinct from `cat` which describes the content itself)
- agentic capabilities (declares whether the package can match against
  buyer-supplied embeddings, and on what signal types)

A package optimized for direct response declares dense `standard_segment_ids`
and leaves `agentic_capabilities` null. A package selling content adjacency
declares `contextual_segment_ids`. A package supporting advertiser
first-party activation declares `agentic_capabilities` -- the premium tier.

See proposal §5.7 and bead ar-roi5.

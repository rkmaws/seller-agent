# Claude Setup Guide (Desktop & Web)

Connect your seller agent to Claude Desktop or Claude on the web for conversational management of your media kit, pricing, deals, and buyer relationships.

## Prerequisites

Your developer should have already:
- Deployed the seller agent server
- Connected your ad server (GAM or FreeWheel)
- Connected SSPs (PubMatic, Index Exchange, etc.)
- Generated an operator API key for you

If not, see the [Developer Setup Guide](developer-setup.md) first.

## Step 1: Add the Seller Agent to Claude Desktop

There are two ways to connect, depending on whether the seller agent is running locally or on a remote server.

### Option A: Remote Server (Recommended for Production)

Works on both **Claude Desktop** and **Claude on the web** (claude.ai):

1. Open Claude Desktop or go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
2. Go to **Settings > Integrations**
3. Click **"+ Add Custom Integration"**
4. Enter your seller agent's MCP URL: `https://your-publisher.example.com/mcp`
5. If prompted for authentication, enter your operator API key
6. Click **Save**

> Available on Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans. Free users get one custom integration. This is the same setup for both Claude Desktop and Claude web — the integration syncs across both.

### Option B: Local Development Server

For seller agents running on `localhost`:

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Go to **Settings > Developer > Edit Config**
3. This opens `claude_desktop_config.json`. Add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "seller-agent": {
      "command": "uvicorn",
      "args": ["ad_seller.interfaces.api.main:app", "--port", "8000"],
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "your-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

4. Save and restart Claude Desktop

> **Note**: The JSON config method is for **local stdio servers only**. Remote servers must use the Settings > Integrations UI.

Alternatively, if you are running the seller agent as an HTTP server (`uvicorn ad_seller.interfaces.api.main:app --port 8000`), use `mcp-remote` to bridge it:

**Using npx (Node.js required):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "seller-agent": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "http://localhost:8000/mcp/"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Using uvx (Python only, no Node.js needed — `uvx` comes with `uv`):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "seller-agent": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "http://localhost:8000/mcp/"]
    }
  }
}
```

> The trailing slash on `/mcp/` is required.

## Step 2: First-Run Setup Wizard

Type `/setup` to begin the guided configuration wizard.

> **Claude**: "Welcome! Your seller agent is deployed and connected to your ad server. Let's set up the business configuration. I'll walk you through 8 steps — you can skip any step to accept defaults."

### Step 1: Publisher Identity

> **You**: "We're ESPN Digital"
>
> **Claude**: "Got it. I've set your publisher name to 'ESPN Digital'. What's your primary domain?"
>
> **You**: "espn.com"

### Step 2: Agent Behavior

> **Claude**: "Your seller agent has a 3-level AI hierarchy. The top-level Inventory Manager optimizes for your business goals. What should it prioritize?"
>
> **You**: "Maximize yield but maintain a $15 floor on CTV"

### Step 3: Media Kit

> **Claude**: "I found 24 inventory packages synced from your ad server. Here are the top ones: [list]. Want to customize these or create new packages?"
>
> **You**: "Feature the CTV Sports package and the Premium Video bundle"

### Step 4: Pricing Rules

> **Claude**: "Your current rate card: CTV $35, Video $25, Display $12. Want to adjust?"
>
> **You**: "Raise CTV to $40 and set a 15% discount for advertiser-tier buyers"

### Step 5: Approval Gates

> **Claude**: "Want to approve deals before they go live, or auto-approve?"
>
> **You**: "Auto-approve deals under $50 CPM from preferred buyers. Require approval for everything else."

### Step 6: Buyer Agents

> **Claude**: "Who should be allowed to buy from you?"
>
> **You**: "Register GroupM's buyer agent and set them as preferred"

### Step 7: Curators

> **Claude**: "Agent Range is set up to curate deals. Want to add any other curation partners?"
>
> **You**: "No, just Agent Range for now"

### Step 8: Review & Launch

> **Claude**: "Here's your complete setup: [summary]. Everything looks good. Your seller agent is live!"

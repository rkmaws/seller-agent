# Ad Seller Agent

The Ad Seller Agent is an **IAB OpenDirect 2.1 compliant** programmatic advertising seller system. It enables automated ad selling through AI agents, supporting the full lifecycle from inventory discovery through deal execution, SSP distribution, and post-deal management.

**Manage everything from Claude, ChatGPT, or any MCP-compatible AI assistant** — the seller agent exposes 41 MCP tools for conversational setup and day-to-day operations. An interactive setup wizard walks publishers through configuration step by step.

Part of the IAB Tech Lab Agent Ecosystem --- see also the [Buyer Agent](https://iabtechlab.github.io/buyer-agent/).
